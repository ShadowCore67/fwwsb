# Fallout: Wasteland Warfare Squad Builder

A website for managing squads for use with the Fallout: Wasteland Warfare tabletop created by Modiphius.

## Changelog 0.0.3

### New:
- Units and items now have their factions/categories/uniqueness displayed as subtext
- Unique units/items now display the "unique" tag and will prevent the user from adding more than one
- A message will now display when the user's squad is empty

### Fixes:
- Unit delete buttons now properly delete the associated unit
- A lot of missing cards fixed

### Known Issues:
- Several units/items are still missing their images. Most of these remaining cards are due to lack of having a pdf rather than my typos.
